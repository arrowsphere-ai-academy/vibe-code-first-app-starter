# Vibe Code First App Starter

This repository is a starter template to vibe code your first app in the browser using GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot.

## How to get started

1. **Open this repository in a Codespace**
   - Click the green **“Use this template”** button at the top right.
   - Select **“Open in a Codespace”**.
   - Wait a few minutes while the environment is prepared (this happens the first time you open the Codespace).

2. **Check that everything is ready**
   - Python and the required libraries (Streamlit, Plotly, etc.) are already being installed for you.
   - GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat are available in the editor.

3. **Start vibe coding**
   - Follow the tutorial steps to create a new file named `app.py`.
   - Use Copilot Agent to generate and improve your application code.
   - To run your app, ask Copilot or type in the terminal:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
   - A browser tab will open showing your app.

4. **Iterate and enhance**
   - Use Copilot Agent to refine the code, add new features, and fix errors.
   - Refresh the browser tab to see your changes.

## Notes

- Codespaces may take a few minutes to start the first time.
- After you close your Codespace, you can reopen it from your GitHub account without rebuilding everything.
- Each Codespace runs in your personal GitHub account. Free accounts include a monthly quota of Codespaces usage (120 core-hours).
